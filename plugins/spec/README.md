# Spec

**Status: Experimental** - This plugin is under active development and the API may change.

## Purpose

Spec-centered development workflow plugin inspired by [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). Maintains specifications as the single source of truth that drives all development artifacts including documentation, code, and tests. Specifications preserve requirement history even as implementations evolve, ensuring coding agents can follow clear requirements without losing context after code changes.
