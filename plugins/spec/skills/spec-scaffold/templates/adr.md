[DATE] - [ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_NAME]
===

## Motivation

<!--
  Motivation Example
  ===

  Our database is heavy on read operations than write operations. After users is growing, we need to optimize read performance to ensure low latency and high availability.

  ### Stackholder

    - **Users**: Expect fast response times when accessing data.
    - **Developers**: Need to maintain and scale the database efficiently.

  ### Problem Statement

    The current database setup is struggling to handle the increasing read load, leading to slow response times and potential downtime during peak usage periods.

## Proposed Solution

<!--
    Proposed Solution Example
    ===

    We have considered the following solutions to address the read performance issue:

    ### Redis Caching

    Implementing Redis as an in-memory caching layer to store frequently accessed data. This will reduce the load on the primary database and speed up read operations.

    ### Read Replicas

    Setting up read replicas of the primary database to distribute read traffic. This will help in balancing the load and improving read performance.

## Consequences

<!--

    Consequences Example
    ===

    Implementing Redis Caching will have the following consequences:

    ### Positive Consequences

    - Improved read performance, leading to faster response times for users.
    - Reduced load on the primary database, enhancing overall system stability.

    ### Negative Consequences

    - Additional infrastructure to manage and maintain (Redis server).
    - Potential data consistency issues if cache is not properly invalidated.
