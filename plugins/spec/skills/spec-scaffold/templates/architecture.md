This document outlines the high-level architecture and design for the project.

## Technology Stack

<!--
    Technology Stack Example
    ===

    - **Ruby**: Primarily used for backend development.
    - **Ruby on Rails**: Web application framework for building the backend services.
    - **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data storage.
    - **StimulusJS**: JavaScript framework for enhancing frontend interactivity.
    - **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Cloud platform for hosting and deploying the application.
    - **RDS**: Managed relational database service provided by AWS.

    Replace the above with actual technologies and versions used in your project.

   Add more sections related to architecture patterns, design decisions, and rationale as needed.

   Pattern Example
   ===

   ## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

   This project follows a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) pattern to promote modularity and scalability. Each domain is encapsulated within its own service, allowing for independent development and deployment.

   ```ruby
   # path: lib/domains/notification/services/send_email_service.rb
    module Domains
      module Notification
         module Services
            class SendEmailService
              def initialize(user, message)
                 @user = user
                 @message = message
              end

              def call
                 # Logic to send email
              end
            end
         end
      end
    end
   ```

   - Use `#call` method to execute the service.
   - Naming convention: `[Action]Service` for service classes.
   - Place services under `lib/domains/[DOMAIN_NAME]/services/`.
