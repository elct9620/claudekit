  Additional Sections
  ===

  The additional sections is designed to domain-specific features. Each section should scope a particular domain or module within the project.
  Do not create new sections unless user specifically requests it.
  This usually happens in large projects with multiple domains, e.g. `User` has different meanings in `Authentication` and `Analytics` domains.
