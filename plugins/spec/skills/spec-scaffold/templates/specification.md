[PURPOSE_DESCRIPTION]

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria **(mandatory)**

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each story should be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning implementing ONE story at a time,
  you should focus on delivering viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to produce value early and often.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
